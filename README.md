# Impact-of-Covid-19-on-Food-and-Air-Quality-in-Africa
Team Alpha - Focusing on Air Quality

# Challenge
Covid-19 provides a unique opportunity of a clear inflection point that was experienced (more-or-less) in parallel across the African continent, and which impacted multiple key aspects of daily life. In this project, the client is interested in understanding what impact Covid-19 had across Africa on:

> Urban air quality - likely as a result of reduced traffic and economic activity resulting in reduced air pollution, especially in high-density city centres. For example, were there more mentions about air pollution or air quality after lockdown compared to before? What were the changes in air quality described pre, during and post lockdown? What were the sentiments associated with these described mentions?

The single data source that the client is interested in for this case is sentiment analysis using data from Twitter. The client wants to explore whether the data and the results are suitable and sufficient for publication and/or to generate new hypotheses to inform future grant applications.
